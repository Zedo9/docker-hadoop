check the number of output files

Challenge #3: add a threshold variable (from commandline) in order to select only frequent terms in class TermFreq.java
(indic. add setup method in reducer class)

Challenge #8: goal increase the number of mappers
generate customer.tbl using SF=100
repeat challenge #4 and change the input split to 64MB   
check hadoop counts

Challenge #9: 
update container RAM/nbr of cores HW config for mappers and reducers (increase and decrease)
check hadoop counts
